## Time string format
The most simple accepted time string is a plain number. This will be interpreted as time in seconds. In addition to this format you may specify a time with time symbols. The time symbols are:
* d - Days
* h - Hours
* m - Minutes
* s - Seconds

An example time string with time symbols: 1d20m.

Your time string may include any or none of the time symbols, but they must appear in the order they are listed above.
